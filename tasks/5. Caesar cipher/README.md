# Caesar cipher

Implement a function **that takes a string** and a **numeric key**, and **returns the caesar encrypted** version of that string **shifting** the **english ABC** with the key. No whitespaces only **consecutive letters** in mind.

*Caesar cipher is a method in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter with some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

## Examples:

* encodeCaesar("GAMEOFTHRONES", 1) // returns "HBNFPGUISPOFT"
* encodeCaesar("GAMEOFTHRONES", 3) // returns "JDPHRIWKURQHV"

### Bonus
* Implement the function which decrypts an encrypted text, if we know the key. Give more solutions based on different logics if you can.
