Fibonacci(n) - recursive

Implement a recursive function, that takes in a number and returns an array containing the fibonacci numbers until the n-th. Start the sequence with 0.

*The Fibonacci sequence is a set of numbers that starts with a one or a zero, followed by a one, and proceeds based on the rule that each number (called a Fibonacci number) is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers.

Example:

Fibonacci(7) // returns [0,1,1,2,3,5,8]
