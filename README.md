# Javascript tests for internship/junior developer applicants
This is a repository **for employees** to review their interview subjects current level of knowledge and thinking. Also for **js-developer wannabes** to practice and learn. 

**Try to give a generic solution, rather than just satisfy the unit tests, since it doesn't do any good for anyone.:)**

## The tests consist of implementation of several algorithms:
1. [Palindromes](https://github.com/tokdaniel/js-test/blob/master/tasks/1.%20Palindrome%20check/README.md) - Check if the given input is a palindrome.
2. **Fibonacci** - Implement a function recursively, which returns the fibonacci numbers until N.
3. **Balanced Parentheses** - Determine if the given input string's parentheses are balanced.
4. **FizzBuzz** - Give your implementation of FizzBuzz.
5. **Caesar's Cipher** - Give your implementation of Caesar's cipher
6. **Reduce** - Implement the javascript utility reduce.
7. **Circle Contains** - Determine if a given point is inside the area of a circle.

### In every task folder there is a more detailed explanation of the expected task.
These are in order of difficulty (according to my subjective judgement).

## What you'll need to solve them
* Your favourite IDE, editor or other stuff that lets you conveniently edit code.
* Cloning, or saving this repository to your local filesystem.
* Some of the newer versions of node.js (https://nodejs.org).
* Opening a command line and run ```npm install``` in the root folder.
* Diving in & some usage of google

## Check your solutions
If you think your solution is fine run the **check.bat** file it will open a **report in your default browser** and tell you if something is wrong. If you are using linux or mac, I hope you'll know what to do (execute the npm test command, and open mochawesome.html).
